## Hey there 🫴

<!--

I'm Amarthya, a fullstack engineer based in India.

I build products that i think are useful for me, or that i think would be cool to build.

My main tech stack right now is :
- Languages: Typescript, Javascript, Bash, SQL (Database)
- Backend : Express (Node), Postgresql, Docker (Deployment containerization)
- Clientside : React, Tailwind
- Test : Jest , Supertest (Api tests), Testcontainers
- Dev : Git, Linux

My finished projects are - [draw-code](https://github.com/ramarthyasc/draw-code) & [superflow](https://github.com/ramarthyasc/superflow)

💻 { "current_status" : "trying to deploy draw-code app" }

Fun facts:
- does build things, trains strength
- uses nvim btw :)
